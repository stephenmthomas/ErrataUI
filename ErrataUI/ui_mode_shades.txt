In regular 'light mode', _500 is the "main" shade for each color

In dark mode, _750 should be the "main shade"

Invert Lightness: Swap lighter shades for darker ones. For example:

Neutral_100 → Neutral_900
Primary_200 → Primary_800
Secondary_300 → Secondary_700
Semantic_50 → Semantic_950
Adjust Contrast: Ensure text remains readable by using a high contrast ratio between foreground and background.

Preserve Semantic Meaning: Colors like warnings and success messages should retain their intent while adapting to the darker scheme.

Modify Background & Surface Colors:

Light backgrounds (Neutral_50) should become dark (Neutral_900 or 1000).
Mid-tone surfaces (Neutral_500) might need slight darkening to fit better.
